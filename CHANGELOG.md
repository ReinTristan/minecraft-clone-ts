# Changelog

All notable changes to MC-Clone, newest first.

> **On the older entries:** versions from 0.4.0 onward are written as they ship. Everything before that was reconstructed from the commit history. Entries marked **†** were never bumped or tagged at the time — their number was assigned retroactively so the history reads in order, and their date is when the work landed rather than when it was released.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-08-12

Naming, licensing and structure.

**Added**
- `LICENSE.md` (MIT). It covers the code **and** the block artwork, since every texture is pixel art written in TypeScript rather than an image file.
- A License section in the README explaining exactly that.

**Changed**
- The project is now called **MC-Clone** — in the menu, the page title, the social preview tags, `package.json` and the README. Minecraft is still mentioned, but only as a description of what the project is inspired by.
- New font: [Pixelify Sans](https://fontsource.org/fonts/pixelify-sans) (Open Font License), replacing the previous pixel font. Bold weights are now real weights instead of a synthetic thickening.
- The Zustand stores moved to `src/store/`, so `src/hooks/` finally contains only hooks.

**Fixed**
- Removed a leftover debug log that fired on every mouse-wheel scroll.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-11 — Runtime texture engine

The biggest change since the project started: **there are no image files anymore.**

**Added**
- Every block texture is original pixel art declared in TypeScript — a color palette plus a 16×16 grid of characters — drawn onto a canvas when the game starts. Nothing in the repo derives from Mojang's artwork.
- Tints and overlays are declarative. Grass gets its green from a tint over a grayscale sprite, and its side face layers a real overlay on top of dirt.
- A loading screen while textures are generated.
- Adding a new block is now two edits: draw a sprite, add an entry to the block list.

**Changed**
- Textures load asynchronously instead of blocking at import time.
- All 12 sprites were redrawn after a visual review — stone, cobblestone, planks and the log top were reworked because they read as the wrong material at a glance.
- Glass no longer dims what's behind it. It's still see-through; it just doesn't tint the view.

**Removed**
- Every Mojang-derived image, including the old favicon and the block metadata JSON files they fed.
- Dead files and unused imports left over from the old texture system.

**Fixed**
- The grass side overlay, which had been declared in the data but silently never rendered.
- The ground plane reconfiguring its texture on every render.
- A typo in a block name (`stone_bicks`).

Shipped in four preview tags, `v0.4.0-preview-0` through `-3`.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-08-07

Dependency and correctness pass before starting the texture work.

- Upgraded to Vite 8 and TypeScript 7, with the migrations their breaking changes required.
- Set a minimum Node version and sorted out the deployment configuration.
- Fixed memory leaks: the player's physics subscriptions now clean themselves up.
- Removed the browser-detection warning and a batch of unused helpers.
- Switched to releasing from a `dev` branch with proper version numbers.

---

## 0.3.2 † — 2026-02-18

Tooling.

- Moved from npm to pnpm.
- Replaced ESLint + Prettier with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as the single linter and formatter, then applied it across the whole codebase.
- Several rounds of dependency and security updates, mostly React advisories.

---

## 0.3.1 † — 2025-05-19

Blocks stopped being one texture on all six sides.

- Blocks can define a different texture per face, which is what logs and grass need.
- Block metadata moved into a data file instead of living hardcoded in components.
- More blocks: stone, cobblestone, planks, bricks, stone bricks, oak log.
- Texture selection and the hotbar reworked around the new data.
- An info panel on the main menu.
- Fixed textures failing to load in production builds.

---

## 0.3.0 † — 2025-05-12

Styling and layout.

- Styling migrated to Tailwind CSS; the hand-written stylesheet is gone.
- The hotbar was rebuilt — and it finally works in Firefox.
- Components reorganized into UI / World / Player folders.

---

## 0.2.3 † — 2025-05-03

- Dependency refresh after a year away from the project.
- Removed unused PointerLockControls options.

---

## 0.2.2 — 2024-03-02

- Reverted a movement experiment that tied the walking direction to where the camera was pointing; looking up or down no longer changes where you go.
- The game loop stops while the pause menu is open.
- A warning for browsers the game doesn't support.

---

## 0.2.1 — 2024-02-24

- Social preview: Open Graph meta tags and an icon, so shared links render properly.

---

## 0.2.0 — 2024-02-24

Menus and persistence.

- Main menu and pause menu.
- Multiple worlds, saved to and loaded from the browser's local storage.
- A pixel font for the interface.
- Bedrock block.

---

## 0.1.1 — 2024-02-22

- A static server so the built game can actually be deployed.
- Build fixes.

---

## 0.1.0 — 2024-02-22

First playable version — the voxel sandbox from the [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/danba340/minecraft-freecodecamp) / [Midudev](https://github.com/midudev/minecraft-clone) tutorial, rewritten in TypeScript.

- Pointer-lock camera, WASD movement and jumping, with physics.
- Place and break blocks.
- A texture selector and five block types.
- An infinite-looking ground plane.
